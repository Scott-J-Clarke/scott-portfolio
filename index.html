                    As a teacher for 15 years, and I did a lot of listening. I listened to students, colleagues, and parents. I learned to listen closely, to give each person my full attention, and to paraphrase back to them what I thought they had just said.<br><br>

                    I enjoy learning. In the past year, I've learned how to build basic web applications using JavaScript, Node.js, Handlebars, Bulma, and other technologies. I've learned how to deploy these creations to GitHub and Heroku.<br><br>

                    I love to read. I did my undergraduate degree in English and history, which meant I was reading for hours and hours each day. As a teacher, I read to prepare better lessons, and as a programmer I read to improve my code.<br><br>

                    Writing is thinking. It's last on this list because when I write I gather in what I've heard, learned, and read, and try to create something unique with it. While writing is not easy, it is something that I like to do.
