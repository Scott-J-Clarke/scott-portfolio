                <span class="is-italic">What does it mean to be a listener, learner, reader, and writer?</span><br><br>

                As a teacher for 15 years, I did a lot of listening. I listened to students, colleagues, and
                parents. I learned to listen closely, to give each person my full attention, and to paraphrase
                back what I thought they had just said, asking the person to correct me.<br><br>

                I enjoy learning. In the past year, I've learned how to build basic web applications using
                technologies like JavaScript, Node.js, Handlebars, and Bulma. I've learned how to deploy these
                creations to GitHub and Heroku.<br><br>

                I like to read. I did my undergraduate degree in English and history, which meant I was reading for
                hours and hours each day. As a teacher, I read to prepare better lessons, and as a programmer I
                read to improve my code.<br><br>

                Writing is thinking. It's last on this list because when I write I gather in what I've heard,
                learned, and read, and try to create something unique with it. Writing is simple, but not easy, and
                it's something I love to do.
