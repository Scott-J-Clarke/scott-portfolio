## Description

The main purpose of this portfolio is to display my coding projects. 

It was built with HTML, Bulma, and some custom CSS.

I have linked five projects:

- "Daily Dose of Tech" is a blog-style, full stack web application, using the MVC framework
- "Note Taker" is meant for a user to write, save, and review notes
- "Logo Generator" lets a user make a customized logo
- "What's the Weather?" informs users about weather conditions around the world
- "Working Day Calendar" allows a user to track and tackle their daily to-do list

Through building this portfolio, I:

- gained experience using Bulma
- better understand how to add-in custom CSS
- received some helpful design and layout advice from a TA
